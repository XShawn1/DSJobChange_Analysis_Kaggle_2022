# DSJobChange_Analysis_Kaggle_2022
5 data exploratory analysis questions regarding Data Scientists' job changing were answered and visualised by Tableau
## Acknowledgment
This report has been adapted from Bayes (Cass) Business School 2022-2023 MSc Business Analytics SMM635 final individual project and refined to present the analysis in a coherent flow. 
## Data Source
Data of this project is from Kaggle, the link to the data is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists
## Research Objectives & Approaches
The original project was an exploratory analysis based on a dataset and was required to have 5 questions that cover as many diverse visualisations as possible. In the repository, the report was amended by adding essential explanations and analysis that put 5 individual parts together seamlessly.
**Data Preprocessing Tool**: Python
**BI Tools**: Plotly(Python) for the radar chart, Tableau for the other 4 charts
## Research Results & Insights
- There are much more males (8992) than females (867) in the market. Female employees may have a less stable career journey.
- A lower intention to switch job in employees’ later career is observed. Employees without relevant experiences are more likely to switch jobs.
- Most of data scientists in the market have bachelor’s degrees, followed by those with master’s degrees. There are very few employees with high school and lower degree.
- Phd employees show significant trend of working in public sector and NGO (non-profit organisation), as Master also shows a slightly similar pattern. This might because employees with higher educational degrees tend to pursue more meaningful achievements in their visions and leverage their knowledge to a larger cause.
- Companies of 50 to 499 employees have the highest number of data scientists, while larger companies have relatively lower proportions of data scientists. An explanation to this trend may be that the number of companies of different sizes in the original dataset is unequally distributed, thus resulting in an unequal distribution of number of data scientists in companies of different sizes. Maybe larger companies have more outsourcing analysts compared with the smaller companies, as the scale requires them to operate in a more flexible way.
- There is an outstanding higher number (10,454) of STEM backgrounds employees than other backgrounds.
- Bachelor and Master have a relatively lower average CDI than others. However, the causal relationship between these two variables is vague. This is because Masters and Bachelors are supposed to have stronger competencies than employees with lower education backgrounds, probably leading to a better living environment. An explanation may be that cities which offer more data scientist vacancies may have lower CDI.
- Although employees from STEM are supposed to have higher levels of skills compared to other majors, they still live in cities that have relatively lower CDI, which indicates that the different distribution in CDI is not totally related to professional competence and can be explained by other factors like personal preference.
